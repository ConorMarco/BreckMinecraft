# Get ready for some Breck Minecraft!

If you're like me, your primary concern right now is ~~the  coronavirus~~ that you're not playing enough Minecraft with your fellow Breckies. **We've got you covered.**

Now, to spice things up a little, we're playing with a few *mods*. Yes, that's right, we're changing up the game. If you don't want to play with the modded content, you don't have to, but I hope you will find them enjoyable. Follow the instructions below to get started!

# Installation

First, make sure you have the **Java edition** of Minecaft installed, along with **Java 8**.

Now, there are two ways to install the modpack. Either use the Twitch launcher, which is the "official" method but can be slow bloatware and doesn't work on Linux, or use MultiMC, an open source alternative which runs faster but requires a little bit more effort to set up.

## Twitch

Install the [Twitch Launcher](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads). When you open the Twitch app, go to the Mods tab. If you have Minecraft installed, it should detect that and display it in that tab.

Once you are there, I highly recommend **changing the amount of RAM that is allocated to Minecraft**. For historical reasons the default is only 2GB, but at least **4GB is recommended** for good performance. Access your settings by hitting `ctrl+comma`. Next, select the `Minecraft` tab on the Settings page and locate the `Allocated Memory` slider under `Java Settings`. Adjust the slider to your desired memory amount (remember we recommend at least 4096MB).

Finally, we will install the modpack. You should be able to `Browse Modpacks` and search for `ATM3L` to find the pack All the Mods 3: Lite. Simply click `install` and it will appear in `My Modpacks`, allowing you to hit `play`!

## MultiMC

Download [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download) and follow the installation instructions for your system. In the top bar, click `Settings`, then go to the `Java` tab on the right. Change the minimum and maximum memory allocation to the desired values - once again, we **recommend at least 4GB**.  Close the settings.

In the top left corner, hit `Add Instance`. Name the instance and then select `import from zip`. Now, in your browser, go to [this link which will download a zip version of the modpack.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/atm-3-lite/download/2756992) Finally, back in the new instance, select the downloaded zip file and you're good to lauch the profile (you may be prompted to login to your Minecraft account first).

We're all Breckies here, just be reasonable. Don't grief people, don't make a giant lag-factory.
