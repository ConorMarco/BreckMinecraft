# Get ready for some Breck Minecraft!

If you're like me, your primary concern right now is ~~the  coronavirus~~ that you're not playing enough Minecraft with your fellow Breckies. **We've got you covered.**

Now, to spice things up a little, we're playing with a few *mods*. Yes, that's right, we're changing up the game. But don't worry, we're still using Minecraft 1.15.2, and we've tailored the mods to provide nice features such as a minimap, extra biomes to explore, and fun crops without altering the fundamental gameplay. So there's no need to worry: if you don't want to play with the modded content, **you don't have to**. But I hope you will find them exciting.

Now you might be saying
> That all sounds well and good, but isn't this going to be **complicated** and **confusing**?

Nope! Just follow the guide below to easily install the Breckinridge modpack and get started on the server!

# Installation

First, make sure you have the **Java edition** of Minecaft installed. Then, install the [Twitch Launcher](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads). (You can use other launchers such as MultiMC, but if you are doing that then I assume you are technical enough that you don't need my help.)

When you open the Twitch app, go to the Mods tab. If you have Minecraft installed, it should detect that and display it in that tab.

Once you are there, I highly recommend **changing the amount of RAM that is allocated to Minecraft**. For historical reasons the default is only 2GB, but at least **4GB is recommended** for good performance. Access your settings by hitting `ctrl+comma`. Next, select the `Minecraft` tab on the Settings page and locate the `Allocated Memory` slider under `Java Settings`. Adjust the slider to your desired memory amount (remember we recommend at least 4096MB).

Finally, we will install the modpack. You should be able to `Browse Modpacks` and search for `ATM3L` to find the pack All the Mods 3: Lite. Simply click `install` and it will appear in `My Modpacks`, allowing you to hit `play`!

## Server Details

Address: 54.39.218.73:25566

## Questions

If you have any questions about installation, please ask them in the minecraft channel on the Discord.

# Server Rules

We're all Breckies here, just be reasonable. Don't grief people, don't be mean, don't make a giant lag-factory. We spent some time setting this up for y'all and I'm going to ~~sneak into your house to slap you~~ be *really annoyed* if I have to deal with people not acting like adults.

Thanks to Conor Marco for setting up the server and the modpack, and to Annie Ullyot for being our primary financial supporter.
