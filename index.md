# Get ready for some Breck Minecraft!

If you're like me, your primary concern right now is ~~the  coronavirus~~ that you're not playing enough Minecraft with your fellow Breckies. **We've got you covered.**

Now, to spice things up a little, we're playing with a few *mods*. Yes, that's right, we're changing up the game. But don't worry, we're still using Minecraft 1.15.2, and we've tailored the mods to provide nice features such as a minimap, extra biomes to explore, and fun crops without altering the fundamental gameplay. So there's no need to worry: if you don't want to play with the modded content, **you don't have to**. But I hope you will find them exciting.

Now you might be saying
> That all sounds well and good, but isn't this going to be **complicated** and **confusing**?

Nope! Just follow the guide below to easily install the Breckinridge modpack and get started on the server!

# Installation

First, make sure you have the **Java edition** of Minecaft installed. Then, install the [Twitch Launcher](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads). (You can use other launchers such as MultiMC, but if you are doing that then I assume you are technical enough that you don't need my help.)

When you open the Twitch app, go to the Mods tab. If you have Minecraft installed, it should detect that and display it in that tab.

Once you are there, I highly recommend **changing the amount of RAM that is allocated to Minecraft**. For historical reasons the default is only 2GB, but at least **4GB is recommended** for good performance. Access your settings by hitting `ctrl+comma`. Next, select the `Minecraft` tab on the Settings page and locate the `Allocated Memory` slider under `Java Settings`. Adjust the slider to your desired memory amount (remember we recommend at least 4096MB).

Finally, we will install the Breck modpack. You should be able to `Browse Modpacks` and search for `Breck Pack Please Ignore` by `comarn`. Simply click `install` and it will appear in `My Modpacks`, allowing you to hit `play`!

## Server Details

Address: 54.39.218.73:25566

## Questions

If you have any questions about installation, please ask them in the minecraft channel on the Discord.

# Useful Server Features

With mods, we've been able to add ~~the ability to edit signs~~ several nice features to the server. These include extra biomes, machines, crops, and decoration blocks as well as many quality of life features. A few of the less obvious features are listed below.

## Recipe manager

When you open your inventory, you will see several pages of blocks and items on the right side of the screen. These can be searched by name, or by mod by searching `@modname`. Doubleclicking this search bar will highlight blocks matching the search in your inventory.

If you click on a block in this menu, it will show you the recipe. Rightclicking will show all the recipes in which it is used. You can access recipes for blocks in your inventory by hovering over them and pressing `r` and `u` respectively.

## Waystones

Waystones look like this [citation needed]. You can teleport from waystone to waystone. You can also create warp scrolls or a reusable warp stone to teleport to any waystone from a remote location. There is one located at spawn and it is expected that players will build them near their bases as well.

## Extra health from foods!

The more kinds of unique food you eat, the more extra health bars you will get!

## Minecolonies

Ever wanted to rule your own colony with an iron fist? Make a supply ship or supply camp to get started! More info [here](https://wiki.minecolonies.com/).

## Minimap

There's a minimap in the top corner of your screen. Press `j` for a fullscreen version or `b` to make a waypoint viewable on the map.

## Gravestones

If you die, a gravestone will appear. Go back to that location and sneak over it to retrieve all your items without worrying about them despawning.

## Ore Excavation

Hold `g` (configurable) to mine all blocks of a certain type at once, e.g. a tree or a vein of ore. This uses up a lot of hunger.

# Server Rules

We're all Breckies here, just be reasonable. Don't grief people, don't be mean, don't make a giant lag-factory. We spent some time setting this up for y'all and I'm going to ~~sneak into your house to slap you~~ be *really annoyed* if I have to deal with people not acting like adults.
