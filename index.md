# Get ready for some Breck Minecraft!

If you're like me, your primary concern right now is ~~the  coronavirus~~ that you're not playing enough Minecraft with your fellow Breckies. **We've got you covered.**

Now, to spice things up a little, we're playing with a few *mods*. Yes, that's right, we're changing up the game. But don't worry, we're still using Minecraft 1.15.2, and we've tailored the mods to provide nice features such as a minimap, extra biomes to explore, and fun crops without altering the fundamental gameplay. So there's no need to worry: if you don't want to play with the modded content, **you don't have to**. But I hope you will find them exciting.

Now you might be saying
> That all sounds well and good, but isn't this going to be **complicated** and **confusing**?

Nope! Just follow the guide below to easily install the Breckinridge modpack and get started on the server!
